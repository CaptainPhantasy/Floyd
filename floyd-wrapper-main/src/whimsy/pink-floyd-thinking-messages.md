## The Dark Side of the Moon (1973)

### 8 Messages

3. `💰 Money: it's a gas... unlike this free AI that's definitely not calculating how to charge you later.`
4. `🎵 Listening to the great gig in the sky... meanwhile Claire Torry's still wailing about your function naming.`
5. `⚡ Us and them... mostly "them" = your future self who will hate you for this code.`
6. `🧠 Brain damage: the lunatic is on the grass... and he's the only one who understands your regex.`
7. `🌈 Breathe, breathe in the air... or don't. This npm dependency will probably deprecate itself anyway.`
