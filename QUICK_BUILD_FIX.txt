QUICK BUILD FIX FOR FLOYD CLI
==============================

THE PROBLEM:
------------
Floyd CLI won't build because it depends on floyd-agent-core,
and floyd-agent-core hasn't been compiled yet.

THE SOLUTION:
------------
Run this command from the project root:

    npm run build

That's it! This will:
1. Build floyd-agent-core first
2. Build floyd-cli second

OTHER OPTIONS:
-------------
If you want to start from scratch:

    npm run clean      # Delete all dist directories
    npm run rebuild    # Build everything fresh

If you want to build just one part:

    npm run build:core    # Build only agent-core
    npm run build:cli     # Build only CLI

TO VERIFY IT WORKS:
--------------------
Check that dist directories exist:

    ls packages/floyd-agent-core/dist    # Should show index.js, etc.
    ls INK/floyd-cli/dist                # Should show cli.js, etc.

TO RUN FLOYD CLI:
------------------
After building:

    cd INK/floyd-cli
    npm start

STATUS: ✅ FIXED - Just run 'npm run build' from root
