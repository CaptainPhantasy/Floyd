# FLOYD CLI

**The AI Coding Agent That Lives In Your Terminal (And Rent-Free In Your Head)**

> *Because paying $20/month for an AI coding assistant is for people who hate money.*

[https://github.com/CaptainPhantasy/Floyd-Code-CLI](https://github.com/CaptainPhantasy/Floyd-Code-CLI)

## What is FLOYD?

Meet Floyd. He thinks he's a Staff Engineer, but he's actually just a very enthusiastic TypeScript process running on your machine.

He does everything those "other" AI assistants do, except:
1. He runs in your CLI (where real developers live).
2. He costs roughly 1/100th of the price (GLM-4 API keys are cheap, friends).
3. He has **Zen Mode** (Ctrl+Z) because looking at code is stressful and sometimes you just need whitespace.

## Features (The Serious Stuff, But Funnier)

*   **Spatial Awareness**: Floyd has `project_map`. He knows where your files are. He won't ask "where is `utils.ts`?" like a lost puppy.
*   **Surgical Hands**: He uses `smart_replace` to fix bugs without rewriting your entire file and deleting your comments.
*   **SuperCaching™**: He remembers things. Three tiers of memory (Reasoning, Project, Vault) so you don't have to repeat yourself like a broken record.
*   **Focus Management**: He knows not to hijack your keyboard shortcuts while you're typing. We taught him manners.

## How To Use Him

1.  **Clone this repo.**
2.  **Install dependencies** (`npm install` inside `INK/floyd-cli`).
3.  **Give him an API Key** (`export GLM_API_KEY=...`).
4.  **Run him** (`npm start`).

```bash
# The magic command
$ npm start

# What happens next
> "Hello! I am Floyd. I have read your entire codebase and I have notes."
```

## Shortcuts (For The Power Users)

*   **Ctrl+Z**: Zen Mode. Hides the sidebars. Pure code. No distractions.
*   **Ctrl+M**: Monitor Dashboard. Watch Floyd think in real-time.
*   **Ctrl+P**: Command Palette. Because clicking is for the weak.

## The "Senior Agent" Upgrade

Floyd recently got a promotion. He now includes:
*   **Explorer Server**: He can map your project structure in milliseconds.
*   **Symbol Lister**: He reads `ctags` (basically) so he knows your function names without reading the implementation.
*   **Scratchpad**: He keeps a to-do list in `.floyd/scratchpad.md`. He's organized. Are you?

## Disclaimer

Floyd is an experimental agent. He might write perfect code. He might delete your `node_modules` (he won't, we added safeguards, but life is a risk). Use with caution and `git commit` often.
