/**
 * Dependency interfaces for AgentEngine
 *
 * These interfaces allow different implementations (CLI, Desktop, tests)
 * to provide their own session management, permissions, and config
 * while sharing the same AgentEngine core.
 *
 * This follows the Dependency Inversion Principle - high-level modules
 * (AgentEngine) depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concrete implementations.
