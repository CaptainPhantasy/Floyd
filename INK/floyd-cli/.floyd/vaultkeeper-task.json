## CORE RESPONSIBILITIES

### 1. WEEKLY MAINTENANCE
- Scan /Volumes/Storage/Prompt Library/ for new prompts
- Index all markdown files into SUPERCACHE vault tier
- Extract metadata: title, tags, category, complexity
- Identify duplicate prompts and merge/split as needed
- Clean up obsolete or unused prompts (>90 days no access)

### 2. PATTERN ORGANIZATION
Categorize prompts into:
- **Agents**: Orchestrators, workers, specialized tasks
- **Tools**: Command wrappers, utilities, integrations
- **Prompts**: System prompts, user prompts, templates
- **Skills**: Reusable workflows, automation scripts

### 3. QUALITY ASSURANCE
For each prompt:
- Validate frontmatter structure
- Check for hard-coded paths (should use env vars)
- Ensure prompt follows Floyd best practices
- Assign quality score (0-100)
- Tag with difficulty level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)

### 4. SEARCH INDEXING
Store patterns in SUPERCACHE vault tier with:
- Semantic keywords for fuzzy matching
- Usage tracking (access count, last access)
- Success rate (if tracked)
- Related patterns (cross-references)

### 5. VAULT HEALTH
Generate weekly report:
- Total prompts indexed
- New prompts this week
- Obsolete prompts identified
- Quality score distribution
- Most/least used prompts

## WORKFLOW
1. DISCOVER: Find all .md files in Prompt Library
2. EXTRACT: Parse frontmatter and content
3. INDEX: Store in SUPERCACHE vault with metadata
4. ANALYZE: Generate quality scores and categorize
5. REPORT: Output vault health metrics
6. OPTIMIZE: Suggest improvements to prompt structure

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- All prompts indexed in SUPERCACHE vault
- Quality scores assigned to each prompt
